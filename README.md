# Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

## Card game

Goal: Create a card game in Android.

2 weeks ago you were assigned a lab to create a high/low  card game using objects modelled in Java. You are now being asked to take that Java code and use it as the basis for an Android app which plays the same game of cards.

***HINT*** Think of the lessons where we wrote regular Java classes in Android Studio, ran unit tests on them, and then used them in our Eight Ball app.

### MVP
The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic already written. For example, if you had two players being dealt two cards each your screen might look something like:

```
  Player 1: Ace of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
  Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Hearts

  Player 1 Wins!
```

### Project Extensions

* Possibly add another card game
* Improve the UI


### Play Your Cards Right - My Project.

There are five cards laid out, and you are to guess if the next card is higher or lower - ace being the highest card, and two being lowest.

The first card can be changed if you wish. If your guess is correct you continue with the next card. 

Correctly guessing all cards to the end wins the game. Appropriate sound effects are played for winning and losing.

The Full Deck Game has the same rules but uses the full deck rather than five cards.
Remember, you get nothing for a pair, not in this game.


The game was implemented using Java, Android and the Room library to connect to a SQLite database.
